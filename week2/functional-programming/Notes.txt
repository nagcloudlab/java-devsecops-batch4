style of programming
-----------------------

1. imperative programming

    -> solving problems by describing a sequence of steps to achieve a desired outcome

    problem:

    -> intention and implementation are mixed
    -> cant reuse implementation with different intentions

 2. declarative  programming

    -> solving problems by describing the desired outcome without specifying the steps to achieve it

    problem:

    -> intention and implementation are separated
    -> can reuse implementation with different intentions

    how to do it:
    way-1 : by primitive or object parameters
