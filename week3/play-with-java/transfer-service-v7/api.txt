how to design REST api
------------------------

Resource identification in requests:

   /api/transfer
   /api/accounts
   /api/accounts/{accountId}


Resource manipulation through representations

   representation of resources: application/json

    GET -> read resource payload
    HEAD -> read resource metadata
    OPTIONS -> read resource options ( what primitions are available )

    POST -> create resource the unknown resource
    PUT  -> to create or update known resource  ( whole resource)
    PATCH -> to update known resource ( partial resource )
    DELETE -> to delete resource

 Self-descriptive messages: aka header  information

   Content-Type: application/json
   Accept: application/json
   Location: /api/accounts/12345

 Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
